# Sam — Digital Construction Engineer (BIM Automation)

<img alt="Profile views" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Sammohammad78&label=Profile+Views" />

I build automation that makes BIM predictable and suitable for industrialised construction.  
Most of my work centres on Revit/Dynamo scripting, prefab logic, and structured 5D outputs.

---

## 🔧 Focus areas

- Automating repetitive Revit workflows (joins, sections, dimension strategies)  
- Prefab housing: rule-based detailing, variants, and productised components  
- Parametric façades with fabrication-ready geometry and schedules  
- 5D / CPQ logic connecting geometry, quantities, and cost  
- Drawing-to-data pipelines for procurement and production

**Day-to-day stack**

- **Revit** 2024/25 for modelling and prefab detailing  
- **Dynamo 2.19+ / Dynamo 4.0 (CPython3 / PythonNet)** for automation logic  
- **Python / pyRevit** for custom tools and QA  
- **APS / Forge + Power BI** to expose BIM data and reporting  
- **n8n ** to connect BIM outputs to wider processes

## 📁 Work examples

- **Dynamo tools for model consistency**  
  Scripts for joins, section alignment, and dimension strategies that follow explicit rules.

- **Prefab & 5D prototypes**  
  Early CPQ-style setups where components drive quantities, cost, and planning.

- **Parametric façade logic**  
  Grids, panels, and schedules designed so geometry and BOMs stay in sync.

Hello — English, العربية, Türkçe, Nederlands.  
I approach automation as a way to reduce variation and eliminate rework.  
Consistent systems create consistent projects.
